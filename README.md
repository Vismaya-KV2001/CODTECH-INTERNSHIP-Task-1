Overview of the Project
Project:Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Weather Forecast Dataset

Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Weather Forecast Dataset.Through this EDA process, we gain valuable insights into the weather dataset,
such as the distribution of different weather features, trends over time, relationships between variables, and any anomalies or outliers.

Key Activities:
>>Data Cleaning:Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
>>Data Visualization:Creating visualizations to understand data distributions,trends and relationships.

Technologies Used:
>>Python:The primary programming language for data analysis.
>>Pandas:Used for data manipulation and analysis.
>>Matplotlib:Employed for creating static,animated and interactive visualizations.
>>Seaborn:Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.

Key Insights:
>>Data Distribution: Understanding the distribution of weather variables like temperature, humidity, and wind speed through histograms helps identify patterns and outliers.
>>Missing Data Handling: Identifying and handling missing values ensures the dataset is clean for further analysis.
>>Feature Relationships: Correlation heatmaps reveal relationships between weather features, such as how temperature correlates with humidity or wind speed.
>>Trends Over Time: Time series analysis helps detect trends and seasonal patterns in weather data.
>>Outlier Detection: Boxplots highlight potential outliers in numerical features like temperature.
>>Category Analysis: Count plots provide insights into the frequency of different weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
